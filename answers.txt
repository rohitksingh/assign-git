Q: What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A: Fast forward in git means while making a pull request if the new
revision can be reached without performing any merges conflicts. For example, if you are working on a branch “A” and making multiple changes(commits), as long as no-one changes anything in the master branch you can update the master
branch with your changes without even working about the conflicts.

Q: Why should you have different branches?
A: In a project, different branches are needed so that each developer can work on its branch without disturbing the code of another developer. Even in a project where one developer is deleting it is a nice idea to create a new branch for a new feature. When the feature is developed it should be tested and when everything works fine then it should be merged. Having multiple branches in a project makes less error-prone development environment.

Q: In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A: A project can have any number of remote repositories.
